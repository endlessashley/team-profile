  ## Description

  A command-line application using Node.js and Inquirer that accepts user input to automatically generate a handy webpage (of HTML and CSS/Bootstrap) displaying a company's software development team. Teams can include managers, engineers, and interns, and the code can be easily scaled to include other roles and employee information as well.
